## Overview

yc-ui is a component library designed for Vue 3.3 and TypeScript. This library aims to simplify the development of user interfaces by providing reusable components. Each component is built with performance and usability in mind. 

The library leverages the capabilities of Vue 3.3, including its Composition API, and integrates seamlessly with TypeScript for type safety. This combination ensures that developers can create robust applications with less effort.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained, allowing for easy integration.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript to catch errors early in development.
- **Vue 3.3 Compatibility**: Utilizes the latest features of Vue 3.3.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be minimalistic and efficient.

## Installation

To get started with yc-ui, you can install it via npm. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install yc-ui
```

Once installed, you can import the components you need into your Vue application.

## Usage

To use yc-ui in your Vue project, you need to import the components. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to do this:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import { YcButton } from 'yc-ui';

const app = createApp(App);
app.component('YcButton', YcButton);
app.mount('#app');
```

You can then use the `<YcButton>` component in your templates:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <YcButton label="Click Me!" @click="handleClick" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      alert('Button clicked!');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
